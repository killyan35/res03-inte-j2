                     Something was wrong with me. But what? Most of the physicians I’ve seen in my 
                     life made me feel like they didn’t care about me or my problems.

                <h3>Why the security engineers loves working in fosec</h3>
                <p>
                    Working in cybersecurity means you’re constantly playing a game of catch-up. 
                    Every day you learn something new, but your work is also never finished.

                <p>
                    Here is a fun fact to stick in the back of your mind for 
                    trivia night or to use as an interesting ice breaker: the 
                    Amazon River has no bridges. None. Zero. Zilch. That is in 
                    spite of the fact that the Amazon is 4,345 miles long.

                <h3>Msoft's smart fabric that can detect objects and gestures</h3>
                <p>
                    About eight or ten years ago, I was excited about smart 
                    fabric and connected textiles — especially about what the 
                    next generation could be once the materials evolved.

                <h3>Can You Build Muscle When You’re Older?</h3>
                <p>
                    The answer is a strong yes, and here’s why you should start 
                    now. If you are over age 30 and not working to counter the 
                    natural effects of aging, your muscles are wasting away as 
                    you read this.
